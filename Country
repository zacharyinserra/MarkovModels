til the day turned into night
and took turns with a jar
turn that boat dock into a bar
and then we passed the guitar around the fire to each other
and watched all of our friends pair off with one another
but we felt like the stars we were under
and everybody knew that that was our summer

it might notve been you but i cant judge
just be proud of what makes you country

silver queen corn in a backyard dirt
waiting for the fall to finally come along
so i can grab my gun and get my outside on

it might notve been you but i cant judge
just be proud of what makes you country

whatever kind of square that you drove around
do you wear in on your sleeve or keep it deep down
you know you gotta let it out
