ah
i tried it once before but i didnt get too far
i felt a lot of pain but it didnt stop my heart
and all i really wanted was someone to give a little fuck
but i waited there forever and nobody even looked up
i tried it once before and i think i might a messed up
i struggled with the veins and i guess i didnt bleed enough
but maybe im alive because i didnt really wanna die
but nothing very special ever happens in my life
take the blade away from me
i am a freak i am afraid that
all the blood escaping me wont end the pain
and ill be haunting all the lives that cared for me
i died to be the white ghost
of the man that i was meant to be
i tried it like before and this time i made a deep cut
i thought about my friends and the way i didnt give enough
and i should a told my mother mom i love you like a good son
but this life is overwhelming and im ready for the next one
take the blade away from me
i am a freak i am afraid that
all the blood escaping me wont end the pain
and ill be haunting all the lives that cared for me
i died to be the white ghost
of the man that i was meant to be yeah
i tried it once again and i think i might black out
i should a left a letter but i had nothing to write about
my blood is all around me i get dizzy if i stand up
the cutting part was easy but regretting it is so fucked
take the blade away from me
i am a freak i am afraid that
all the blood escaping me wont end the pain
and ill be haunting all the lives that cared for me
i died to be the white ghost
of the man that i was meant to be
i tried it once again and i think i went too far
the man that i was meant to be
i cut a little deeper and the pressure stopped my heart
the man that i was meant to be
i couldnt tell my mother that i love her im a bad son
this life is overwhelming and im ready for the next one
from the manner of
cutting whisper
rising vapors through
clouds of gold
giving fire and
change the demons
with undercurrents
far too strong to haul
the sun burnt out today
fools are dancin in the rain
stopped by the acid stain
and on the shelf the jar that holds my brain
nightfall hunts us all
from the shadows
cynical beauty now
lies the host
before the flicker
theres only blackness
the end is coming
all my friends are dead
the sun burnt out today
fools are dancin in the rain
stopped by the acid stain
and on the shelf the jar that holds my brain
rid by an empty world
suffer the crushing weight
madness will crawl inside
alter the selfish stage
feeding on the voices in my head
the unruled hedges we
turn to someone
all those weeping will
go unheard
up on that once green hill
around the mazes
and seeing the darkness
the jaws will take it slowly
the sun burnt out today
fools are dancin in the rain
stopped by the acid stain
and on the shelf the jar that holds my brain
rid by an empty world
suffer the crushing weight
madness will crawl inside
alter the selfish stage
youre feeding all the voices in my head
youre feeding all the voices in my head
theyre feeding all the voices in my head
theyre feeding all the voices in my head
if i fall again will it be the end
i know its wrong
you think im strong but i just pretend
is it taking over
will it bury me
or will clarity become the cure for my disease
stuck at the surface
not making progress
falling apart
well im trying my hardest
looking for answers
finding a rope
is the noose getting tighter
im losing control
will the end make me whole again
its like holding on
when my grip is lost
i still feed my insecurity when i know the cost
is it taking over
will it bury me
or will clarity become the cure for my disease
im getting older
still lost as ever
faking a smile while i bury the pressure
why does this happen
i should be fine
but i cant shake the feeling im living a lie
will the end make me whole again
its like holding on
when my grip is lost
i still feed my insecurity when i know the cost
is it taking over
will it bury me
or will clarity become the cure for my disease
if i fall again will it be the end
i know its wrong
you think im strong but i just pretend
is it taking over
will it bury me
or will clarity become the cure for my disease
its like holding on
when my grip is lost
i still feed my insecurity when i know the cost
is it taking over
will it bury me
or will clarity become the cure for my disease
become the cure for my disease
theres a light in you
that tears me down to nothing
theres an angel in your eyes
theres a hope inside
that you can make it better
you see right through my disguise
when it rains it pours
and everybody stumbles
i wont let them bring you down
i wont let you down
when the seasons change
i wont go down
ill fight through the pain
ill be there right by your side
ill never let them bring you down
when the seasons change
theres a hope in me
that i will die for something
was the fire in my eyes
all this pain inside
will it be this way forever
i can run but i cant hide
when it rains it pours
and everybody stumbles
i wont let them bring me down
i wont let you down
when the seasons change
i wont go down
ill fight through the pain
ill be there right by your side
ill never let them bring you down
when the seasons change
when the seasons change
and were in for colder weather
look for me on the divide
i wont let you down
when the seasons change
i wont go down
ill fight through the pain
ill be there right by your side
ill never let them bring you down
i wont let you down
when the seasons change

between a rock and a hard place
you hoped you found what would slow me down

has got me hating everyone that i see
and all these faces
im so afraid of the state of my mind
everyones looking at me
i can hear the chaos and the fear
im not alone but no ones here
so im listening for the silence now
i swear i can hear it so clear
even though its loud inside my head
so im silent silent
my fear is you dont hear what i hear
can you make the voices disappear
so i keep listening for the silence
listening for the silence
teasing well youre defeating my patience
im breaking scared of all the shadows i see
and could you save me
anybody know what theyre saying
please tell me i just want them to leave
i can hear the chaos and the fear
im not alone but no ones here
so im listening for the silence now
i swear i can hear it so clear
even though its loud inside my head
so im silent silent
my fear is you dont hear what i hear
can you make the voices disappear
so i keep listening for the silence
when these words fail
then nothing just might make sense
are you talking to me
are you speaking to me
cause when these words fail
then nothing just might make sense
cause when these words fail
then nothing just might make sense
are you talking to me
are you speaking to me
cause when these words fail
then nothing just might make sense
and you can say anything
then nothing just might make sense
i swear i can hear it so clear
even though its loud inside my head
so im silent silent
my fear is you dont hear what i hear
can you make the voices disappear
so listen listen
i swear i can hear it so clear
even though its loud inside my head
so im silent silent
my fear is you dont hear what i hear
can you make the voices disappear
so i keep listening for the silence
rushed and told
and betting continued
be at their marks
but somehow and hold
and wont be held
under the spell
bribed when tried
is focused on the balling
of the men to know
got left inside underbellys choke
well you assumed
at least theyll call us
men again
for all shadows
that keep on crawling
out from under close
behold rest assured
the sleep walking elite
when their days
are numbered like the shallow
when they sit
on their knees
on their knees
on their knees
as they sit
on their knees
on their knees
on their knees
well you are should
at least theyll call us
men again
for all shadows
that keep on crawling
out from under close
close
well you assumed
at least theyll call us
men again
for all shadows
that keep on crawling
out from under
well you assumed
